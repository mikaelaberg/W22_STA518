1. Describe a class where you felt your final grade in a course did not match with what you learned throughout the semester (this could be where your grade was “too low” or “too high”).  

My first writing class in college went this same way. I had done all the instructors changes and updates to my final portfolio. But the way writing 150 was structured was that your portfolio would be sent to 3 different random reviewers and the average grade would be provided to you. So, before I submitted my portfolio I met with the professor, and she said it looked great. However, I received a C in the class, and I felt that if the instructor said that I did great then I should have gotten and A. Thinking back on that class it was bizarre that the instructors weren’t the ones grading the assignments. Also, the format was MLA but I knew in my degree I would be using APA so that never sat right with me. 


2. What do you think grades represent? What is your experience with grades?

I honestly for the most part in high school and in most of my college classes I never really cared for the grade and just wanted to focus on how to understand a concept. This behavior was especially prevalent in my 3rd and 4th year of my undergraduate. Organic chemistry between two semesters I got a C in the first half and a B- in the second. But the following year when I took biochemistry, I was still able to recall most of my organic chemistry. Unlike some of my friends who focused on the A part of the class and memorization. The funny part about organic chemistry was when it came to doing the free response and writing out reactions, I would do perfect, but when given multiple choice where they’re all almost right one is more right than the other I would fail.  By the time I was in my last lab class of my undergraduate I never even thought about a grade, I just did the work and committed to the research projects. Since in the real research world no one is grading your work, but people will review your work and have comments and questions. 


3. If grades were removed from courses, what would you use for motivation? What value would learning have for you without grades?

I think the general curiosity would be the driving force for me. That is why I chose an undergraduate in cell and molecular biology. When picking a major at GVSU I remember scrolling down looking at the majors they offered, and I saw “Cell and Molecular Biology” and it sounded interesting, so I chose it. I never took AP classes in high school I had no experience in the area. I liked biology in high school and that was it. For me I think when people are allowed to pick where they invest in learning they will ask why and think of more creative questions and solutions to problems and ideas. They have the freedom to be wrong without the worry of failing a class. Because often enough its in failure that people learn the most. A failed experiment isn’t actually a failure, when a hypothesis is tested and it comes out to be false, then we have learned something and that is still valuable information. Often times is can be another pathway of investigation because something didn’t happen when something should have happened. 


4. Describe a time where you took the “easy way out” for an assignment. Why did you choose to go this route?

Funny enough I took an easy way out when it came to my final presentation in my beer brewing class here at GVSU. It is taught by the director of cell and molecular biology, who I am very familiar with and often saw daily (often multiple times a day) . I decided to give a presentation on the benefits of drinking sour beers. I figured when it came time to put the presentation together I could just half ass it in 30 minutes. But in the end, I still was curious about the topic enough to spend a good 3 hours making a 6 slide PowerPoint. My own curiosity got the better of me. I chose that route because I thought it would save me time I would need for finals. In the end I didn’t mind that I had burned 3 hours learning about sour beers. Fyi sour beers are good for your gut health because of the rich vitamin B’s from the beer yeast and also contain lactobacillus which is a good gut bacteria often used for yogurts! 

# Refelction on Reading 
One thing that came to my mind towards the end of the reading was one of my undergraduate classes called Cell and Molecular Biology 405. She decided to not have a grading scale. Instead, she would adjust the scale to the classroom. I sort of saw what she was trying to do but overall, I don’t think it was that beneficial. Maybe even counterproductive. The people I sat next to in class were friends that I had made in my same major. But there were also students from Natural Resource Management and Biology in that class. Where we covered topics WAY out of their field and scope of expertise. So, while my friends and I felt comfortable since we knew we would most likely be the ones with higher grades, we probably in turn made the class that more stressful for the other students. Potentially feeling more like a competition or need to keep up with us. I’m not sure for certain if that is the case it could be an outcome of that type of grading.  

Another thing I thought of was when I took organic chemistry while I was the student struggling on the exams, often my classmates were coming to me with questions on a concept. Often, I was the one drawing on the whiteboard explaining a concept to 3-5 other peers in my class at the library. Or I would come up with different reactions to test everyone on. I was the one teaching the students that would go on to get a 100% on the exam, while I get a 73%. But looking back on that time I feel nothing but good thoughts of organic chemistry.
